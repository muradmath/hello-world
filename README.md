# hello-world
my first git hub repository.

I am an engineer with a Ph.D. in biomedical and electrical engineering, I work on the next generation of biomedical imaging technology, and in my free time I like to experiment with code.
My affection with coding began recently, and I like it because I can immediately see the result of my work.
My goal is to master coding, especially in Python and Ruby.
